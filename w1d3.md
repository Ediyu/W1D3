# Day 3

## Objects
* Associate arrays def = Named Indexes instead of numberic ones
* Key-value pairs
* Data and the methods to act on that data

functions are OBJECTS. 
properties hold data

"This is a string".length 
* computer process works the following way
1. "This is a string" is talked to Javascript
2. Store the data
3. Goes to the . (the . looks for the property)
4. Then calls the length of the string 

* var me = {};
  * me.sayHi = function () {console.log("Hi")}
  * returns the following
    * me.sayHi = [Function]
    * me.sayHi() = executes the function


* Questions:
  1. Does it cause memory issues if I create an object, and create functions within an object, and reference the object to call the function within that object (think of Java ways);

  ##### this
  * this is always a reference to the OBJECT that ran the function 
    * in the above me, the "this.name" = referring to as "me.name"; 
      * var you = {name : Bob}; var me = {name: Peter}; var me.sayHi = function sayHi() {this.name};
      * if I called you.sayHi = me.sayHi; i have created the same functino of sayHi in the you Object
      * and if I called you.sayHi = this will return. "BOB" and not "Peter"


#### [] as a property
  * me.name has the same function as me["name"];
  * javascript always starts from inside the function;
    * var property = "shirt"; 
      * acalling me.[property] == me["shirt"] ; this will be now looking at the property in the object.


  var list = ["name", "shirt"]
  for (var i = 0; i< list.length; i++) {
    var prop = list[i]
    console.log(me[prop]);
  }

##### Complex Data
ARrays within an object within an object

## Imperative
  * Telling the computer HOW to do what you want it to do. for loops
  * for this one would be for(i = 0 ; ...);

## Declarative
  * Telling the computer WHAT to do
  * list.forEach(function(i)) = read it as "for Each of the things in the "list" do......
    * forEach(function youCanNameIt(i) { code... })
      * Best Practice = declare a functino with a name first and THEN put in in the forEach()
      * forEach is only available for arrays.
  * more advanced and looks better

Working code >>>> pretty looking code

#### LSD (Don's approach)
Debugging:
  Logic
  * If i was doing this task as a human, are these the stpes I would use to solve this problem?
  * Pseudo code
  * It does not change which language is used

  Syntax 
  * Did I use the correct language that the computer understands for the logical steps?
  * This is googleable

  Data
  * Do I have access to the data I need in the format I expect?
  * datas are usually given and it doesn't exist, the others are not really relative
